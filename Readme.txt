
Usage
Loading the Pre-trained Vision Encoder-Decoder Model
Begin by loading the pre-trained Vision Encoder-Decoder Model from the "nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning" checkpoint within the Hugging Face Transformers library. Model integrates ViT and GPT-2 architectures and is tailored for the task of image captioning.

Generating Captions for Images
Utilize the image_caption_generate function to generate captions for images. By providing an image URL, this function utilizes the pre-trained model to generate descriptive captions.

Custom Dataset
Defining the Custom Dataset Class: Custom_Dataset
To facilitate training, Defined a custom dataset class named Custom_Dataset. This class reads image-caption pairs from a caption file, creating a dataset tailored for training purposes. The transform parameter enables the application of image preprocessing and transformations.

Training
Loading a Pre-trained Model for Training
Load the model_trained from the "nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning" checkpoint to initiate the training process. This pre-trained model, with its combined ViT and GPT-2 architectures, forms the foundation for further refinement.

Initializing and Conducting Training
The training process involves several key steps:

Initialize an Adam optimizer to manage parameter updates during training.
Iterate over the dataset, executing training iterations.
Compute loss values, backpropagate gradients through the model, and update parameters.
Repeated this process to iteratively enhance the model's performance.
